I am a research assistant at the Department of Earth Sciences of the University of Minnesota. I use computational chemistry calculations to study the physical and chemical properties of crystals and molecules.


## Research Interest

* Computational chemistry (quantum chemistry/First Principles/DFT/_ab initio_/DFT calculations)

* Thermodynamic modeling 

* Machine learning / Deep learning

* Stable isotope fractionation calculation / Geochemistry modeling

* Hydrous defects in Nominally Anhydrous Minerals (NAMs)
