abstract = {Equilibrium fractionation factors of vanadium (V) isotopes among tri- (V(III)), tetra- (V(IV)) and penta-valent (V(V)) inorganic V species in aqueous system and during adsorption of V(V) to goethite are estimated using first-principles calculation. Our results highlight the dependence of V isotope fractionation on valence states and the chemical binding environment. The heavy V isotope (51V) is enriched in the main V species following a sequence of V(III){\textless}V(IV){\textless}V(V). According to our calculations, at 25 °C, the equilibrium isotope fractionation factor between [V5+O2(OH)2]− and [V4+O(H2O)5]2+ (ln⁡$\alpha$V(V)–V(IV)) is 3.9‰, and the equilibrium isotope fractionation factor between [V5+O2(OH)2]− and [V3+(OH)3(H2O)3] (ln⁡$\alpha$V(V)–V(III)) is 6.4‰. In addition, isotope fractionation between +5 valence species [V5+O2(OH)2]− and [V5+O2(H2O)4]+ is 1.5‰ at 25 °C, which is caused by their different bond lengths and coordination numbers (CN). Theoretical calculations also show that light V isotope (50V) is preferentially adsorbed on the surface of goethite. Our work reveals that V isotopes can be significantly fractionated in the Earth's surface environments due to redox reaction and mineral adsorption, indicating that V isotope data can be used to monitor toxic V(V) attenuation processes through reduction or adsorption in natural water systems. In addition, a simple mass balance model suggests that V isotope composition of seawater might vary with change of ambient oxygen levels. Thus our theoretical investigations imply a promising future for V isotopes as a potential new paleo-redox tracer.},

abstract = {Concentration effect on equilibrium inter-mineral isotope fractionation is ubiquitous in solid solution systems, but it is not clear in which concentration range such effect is prominent. Using first-principles calculations, we examine the effect of Ca and Fe contents in orthopyroxene (opx) on its average Ca–O bond length and the equilibrium Ca isotope fractionation factor (103ln$\alpha$) between opx and clinopyroxene (cpx). Our results reveal that the average Ca–O bond length in opx is much smaller than that in cpx and it does not change with variable Ca content x (x and y are mole ratios in CaxFeyMg1−x−ySiO3thereafter here) when x ≤ 1/48. Incorporation of Fe (y ≥ 1/32) into opx with a fixed Ca content can only slightly increase the average Ca–O bond length. 103ln$\alpha$opx-cpxof44Ca/40Ca is linearly correlated with the average Ca–O bond length in opx, suggesting that 103ln$\alpha$opx-cpxof44Ca/40Ca is controlled by opx Ca–O bond strength. Our calculations indicate that the Ca concentration effect on 103ln$\alpha$opx-cpxis significant when x in opx ranges from 2/16 to 1/48, while Fe in natural opx only causes a slight decrease in 103ln$\alpha$opx-cpx. Our results provide insights into Ca isotope fractionation in high-temperature geochemical processes. Given that Ca content x in opx from natural peridotites is usually lower than 1/32 and Fe content y is generally ∼10 mol{\%}, Ca and Fe concentration effects on 103ln$\alpha$opx-cpxin natural samples are negligible. Rather, 103ln$\alpha$opx-cpxis mainly controlled by temperature. 103ln$\alpha$opx-cpxof44Ca/40Ca decreases from 0.50‰ to 0.26‰ when temperature increases from 1000 K to 1400 K if the Fe effect is taken into account. Therefore, if Ca isotope fractionation between opx and cpx ($\Delta$44/40Caopx-cpx) in natural peridotites is greater than 0.50‰ or lower than 0.26‰, it may indicate disequilibrium of Ca isotopes. Finally, the large 103ln$\alpha$opx-cpxrelative to our current analytical precision suggests that $\Delta$44/40Caopx-cpxcan be used as an independent thermometer with a precision comparable to elemental thermometers. Because most naturally occurring minerals are solid solutions with variable chemical compositions, this study presents a guideline to explore the concentration effect on equilibrium isotope fractionation among minerals.},

abstract = {Equilibrium fractionation factors of Ca isotopes among mantle minerals are essential for using Ca isotopes as an important tracer in mantle geochemistry. Using the vibrational frequencies obtained by the first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), we calculated equilibrium fractionation factors of Ca isotopes between two major Ca-bearing minerals, clinopyroxene (cpx) and orthopyroxene (opx). Our results show that opx has much higher 44Ca/40Ca than its co-existing cpx even at high temperatures (e.g., 1273K), agreeing with the observations on mantle peridotites. In addition to the well-known temperature effect, our calculations for the first time reveal that the inter-mineral Ca isotope fractionation factor between opx and cpx also has a strong dependence on the chemical composition of opx (i.e., Ca content). Specifically, it increases substantially with decreasing Ca/Mg (atomic ratio) of opx when Ca/Mgopx is lower than 1/15. Such compositional effect on inter-mineral Ca isotope fractionation provides a convincing interpretation to the different isotope fractionations between coexisting opx and cpx observed in Kilbourne Hole and San Carlos peridotites.},

abstract = {Naturally occurring carbonates have a wide variation in Mg and Ca contents. Using the density-functional-theory calculations, this study examines the effect of Mg and Ca concentrations on bond lengths and equilibrium fractionation factors of Mg-Ca isotopes among calcite-type carbonate minerals (MgxCa1−xCO3). Mg content x and Ca content (1−x) of the investigated carbonate minerals range from 1/12 to 1 and from 1/36 to 1, respectively. Concentration of Ca and Mg in carbonates have significant effects on Ca–O and Mg–O bond lengths when x is close to 0, 0.5 or 1. Because equilibrium isotope fractionation factors (103ln$\alpha$) are mainly controlled by their relevant bond strengths, which can be measured using their average bond lengths, 103ln$\alpha$ of26Mg/24Mg and44Ca/40Ca between calcite-type carbonate minerals and dolomite also vary dramatically with Mg content, especially when x is close to 0 and 1. For instance, at 300 K, 103ln$\alpha$ of26Mg/24Mg between Mg1/12Ca11/12CO3and dolomite (x = 0.5) is ∼−4.3‰, while 103ln$\alpha$ of44Ca/40Ca between Mg23/24Ca1/24CO3and dolomite is ∼6‰. Dolomite is enriched in26Mg but depleted in44Ca relative to all other carbonate minerals, which is consistent with it having the shortest Mg–O bond length and the longest Ca–O bond lengths among all carbonates. At 300 K, a small change of x from 0.5 to 0.6 in dolomite could result in 1‰ variation in 103ln$\beta$ of26Mg/24Mg. Therefore, the concentration effect in carbonate minerals should be taken into account when applying the isotope fractionation factors of carbonate minerals to understand geochemical processes.},

abstract = {15 In this ab initio study, we expand previous investigations of charge-balanced hydrous Mg ((2H) Mg x) and 16 Si ((4H) Si x) defects in forsterite, the Mg end-member of olivine, to address the relative stability of these 17 two defects. First, we systematically search for (2H) Mg x configurations to find possible defect states; 18 second, we include the contribution of vibrational energy and defect configurational entropy in the 19 calculation of formation energies of both defects; third, we address the effect of pressure and 20 temperature simultaneously on their relative stability. Based on these considerations, we demonstrate 21 2 that hydrous Mg defects ((2H) Mg x) can be stabilized with respect to hydrous Si defects ((4H) Si x) at 22 relevant mantle conditions and that configurational entropy and vibrational free energy play key roles in 23 this stabilization. Our results reveal that water speciation in olivine is influenced by temperature and 24 pressure. As mantle physical and chemical properties may be affected by the speciation of water in 25 olivine, application of experimental results to the mantle should account for the temperature and 26 pressure dependent changes in water speciation. 27 28},
